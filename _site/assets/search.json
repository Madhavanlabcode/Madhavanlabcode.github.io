    "content": "Scanning Tunneling Microscopy\n\nIn a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), a metallic, atomically sharp tip gets extremely close to a sample, allowing electrons to quantum mechanically tunnel from the sample to the tip or vice versa. This tunneling decreases exponentially with distance, giving STM its unparalleled spatial resolution. Due to the quantum mechanical nature of the tunneling, STM is able gain information about how electronic states vary with energy and position; a quantity known as the local density of states. Since electrons can tunnel from the sample to the tip and from the tip to sample, STM can study the unoccupied states of a material. The high resolution access to the local density of states and the ability to probe both occupied and unoccupied states makes STM an indispensable tool in the study of quantum materials.\n\n\n",

    "content": "Unconventional Superconductors\n\n\n  \n  QPI in SrRu2O4\n\n\nIn 1957, University of Illinois Professors John Bardeen and Leon Cooper, along with graduate student Robert Schreiffer, published a groundbreaking work on the theory of superconductivity. Known as BCS theory, it provided the first microscopic explanation for superconductivity since its discovery by Onnes in 1911. It was extremely successful until the inception of high temperature superconductors in the late 80s. These superconductors defied explanation by BCS theory and today join a class of materials known as unconventional superconductors. Unconventional superconducting host several competing emergent phenomena and is one of the most pressing research areas for their fundamental physics and potential applications.\n\nTopological Materials\n\n\n  \n  Dirac Mass Acquisition in a  Topological Crystalline Insulator\n\n\nA relatively new class of materials, topological materials are described by the shape, or topology, of their electronic states in momentum space. A material that is topologically non-trivial will have an electronic “shape” that is mathematically distinct from a normal material. A property of topological materials is that they will have unique, protected states at interfaces with materials of trivial topology. These topological states have fascinating features, such as sometimes behaving as if they have no mass, being impervious to backscattering, and being spin-momentum locked. By studying topological materials, we hope to gain fundamental understanding of topology’s role in materials which will be critical for harnessing topological states in novel devices.\n\nStrongly Correlated Electrons\n\n\n  \n  Local disorder in (Sr 1-x La x)2IrO4\n\n\nIn a lot of materials, the properties can be adequately described without considering the role of electron-electron interactions and instead absorbing these effects into renormalized quantities like the effective mass. However in some of the most interesting materials, known as strongly correlated electron systems, these electron-electron interactions cannot be swept under the rug. In fact, these interactions are responsible for entirely new states of matter like  Mott Insulators, Wigner Crystals, and Heavy Fermions. Strongly correlated electron systems are of particular importance for the role they play in high temperature superconductors, with the exact role correlations play in this unconventional superconductivity still a matter of much debate. Since strongly correlated materials are known for their very local properties, STM is uniquely suited to study these systems and provide invaluable insights.\n\nThin Film Growth and Manipulation\n\n\n  \n  Thin Film of FeSe and accompanying Strain Map\n\n\nUsing the two MBE growth chambers in our lab, we are focused on the growth and control of thin films. Thin films are 2D materials who’s thickness can be controlled down to one atomic layer. They often have unique physical properties associated with their reduced dimensionality, including increased superconducting transition temperatures and distinct charge density wave patterns. Thin films also have relatively low total carrier concentrations, making them amenable to gating. Gating allows for the carrier concentration to be continuously tuned in-situ, as opposed to changing the concentration ex situ with substitution or intercalation. Our goal is to gate thin films to understand the effects of the Fermi level’s location on the physics of a material.\n\nTransition Metal Dichalcogenides\n\n\n  \n  QPI in Cu Intercalated TiSe2\n\n\nOften called the “lego blocks” of material science research, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are layered materials consisting of on transition metal (such as W or Ti) for every two chalcogen atom (such as Se or Te). These materials are especially suitable for STM research as the van der Waals bonding in the stacking direction leads to easy cleaving and the layered structure often leads to quasi-2D properties. The weak stacking allows for easy material intercalation in-between layers, often dramatically changing the physical properties. A vast array of phenomena have been observed in TMDCs, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and Mott Insulators to name a few.\n",

    "content": "Located in the basement of the Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois,\nour lab houses four scanning tunneling microscopes and two molecular beam epitaxy growth chambers. These\nstate of the art machines allow for immediate and in depth study of the most interesting material systems.\nOur facilities allow for a diverse range of studies, whether it be of a thin film grown in one of our MBE chambers or a single crystal grown by a collaborator.\n\nAll of our STM’s are built with a combination of Unisoku parts and parts made in house. The MBE’s are entirely homemade, built by former graduate student Kane Scipioni (MBE 1) and current graduate student Guannan Chen (MBE 2).\n\nSTM 1: 300mK, 11T\n\n\n\nThe premier STM in the Madhavan Lab, this STM is capable of achieving a temperature of\n300mK and a magnetic field of 11 Tesla. Enclosed in a soundproof room, this instrument\nis capable of taking high-quality low-noise measurements for several days at a time.\nTypically used to study cleaved samples, this is STM is also used to examine superconducting\nthin films grown within the group.\n\nSTM 2: 4K\n\n\n\nAlso called the Hybrid STM within the group, this STM is internally praised for\nit’s stability and low-noise levels. Operating at liquid helium temperatures and enclosed within a soundproof room atop a tonne of granite,\nthis STM has been responsible for some of the group’s highest resolution measurements.\nAt times this STM has had a small growth chamber attached, giving it the “Hybrid” name.\n\nSTM 3: 2K, 7.5T\n\n\n\nRepurposed from the upgrade of STM 1, this STM might be the first thing you see\nas you walk into the lab. Capable of reaching 2K with a 7.5 T magnetic field,\nthis STM has been busy since its design and assembly just a few years ago. Enjoy the view\nwhile you can, as there are plans to enclose this STM in a soundproof room soon.\n\nSTM 4: 4K Tabletop\n\n\n\nThis STM closely resembles a commercial Unisoku design and is notable for its\nvery low helium consumption. Used especially for thin film growth, the ease of use\nand optical approach make it ideal for characterization of thin films grown within the\ngroup. Additionally, the electronic connections of this STM were designed to facilitate\ngating of thin films, an important research thrust of the group.\n\nMBE 1:\n\n\n\nThe first MBE growth chamber of the group, this MBE specializing in the growth\nof topological samples and tellurides. Current sources include Te, Bi, Sn, W, Sb and SnTe.\nSources can be changed to match the needs of a research project. Crystal growth can be monitored in-situ by RHEED.\n\nMBE 2:\n\n\n\nPacked with seven sources for growth, this MBE has a specially designed sample\nholder to enable collaboration with other research groups at UIUC. While MBE 1\nfocuses on the growth of tellurides, this MBE focuses on the growth of selenides.\nIt also has a RHEED gun that enables in-situ monitoring of sample growth.\n",
