[Nature 631, 60-66 (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07519-5) <br>

We have discovered a novel technique to optically manipulate charge order in the kagome superconductor RbV<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>5</sub>. Using our unique laser-coupled STM set-up, we apply linearly polarized light along high-symmetry directions and find that the relative intensities of CDW peaks can be reversibly switched. We also find that the CDW order can be manipulated by perpendicular magnetic fields. In collaboration with theorists, we show that the simplest CDW matching our data is an out-of-phase combination of vanadium bond order and orbital loop currents. Our laser STM technique opens doors toward dynamical optical control of complex quantum phenomena in quantum materials.

### *Charge-Density-Waves Sensitive to Magnetic Fields in UTe<sub>2</sub>*

[Nature 618, 918-923 (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06005-8) <br>

We have found evidence for an unusual charge-density-wave order in the heavy-fermion, spin-triplet superconductor UTe<sub>2. This interesting CDW is incommensurate and weakens in intensity with increasing magnetic field. In collaboration with theorists, we have constructed a Ginzburg-Landau model for a uniform spin-triplet superconductor which coexists with three triplet pair-density-wave states. Our theory then gives rise to daughter CDWs which would be sensitive to magnetic field due to their origins in pair-density-wave states. Our paper is published along with 3 other reports of pair-density waves measured by STM, as described in this [Nature News & Views article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01996-w).

### *Spin-Selective Tunneling from a Nanowire STM Tip*

{% include figure.html image="/_img/homepage/SmB6_Website_09252022.png" caption="<center>Spin-Selective Tunneling from SmB6 Nanowires</center>" position="left" width="240" height="360" %}  

[Science 377, 1218-1222 (2022)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8765) <br>

Since the discovery of topological insulators (TIs), a variety of applications have been proposed. One of the important characteristics which TIs exhibit is spin-momentum locking, in which the spin of an electron depends on the direction in which it is traveling.  By fabricating nanowire tips with the putative Kondo TI SmB<sub>6, we have been able to observe spin-polarized tunneling with a non-magnetic tip on to the surface of the antiferromagnet FeTe. This novel technique will help pave the way for a number of cutting-edge applications with topological insulators.
